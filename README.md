# Credit Risk Classification Challenge

In this challenge, I created a machine learning model that utilized supervised learning to indentify and analyze loan data. By taking into account several factors such as: loan size, interest, total debt, etc, the model identified trends and was able to determine if a loan was high risk or healthy. I finished this challenge by testing the model through the usage of a confusion matrix to see the efficacy and accuracy on the model.
